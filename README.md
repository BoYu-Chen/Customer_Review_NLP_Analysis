Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews

## Goal
  1. Implement natural language processing (NLP) on customer reviews of a hotel chain
  2. Extract the information on what the reviews are about through topic modeling
  3. Quantify the strength of compliments and complains by applying sentiment analysis
  4. Provide actionable insights to the customer experience division of the hotel chain

## Key Findings and Business Insights
  1. People is important! The interaction between the staff/service/front desk and the customers triggers stronger feelings (both positive and negative).
  2. The issues customers care the most are the front desk (23 % of reviews) and the staff (17% of the reviews).
  3. The issues customers talk the least is room facility (2.5% of the reviews).
  4. The customers are happy about staff and amenity.
  5. The customers complain about bathroom and front desk.
  6. The compliments and complains received by each hotel are in similar topics, but it is still slightly different across the hotels. The managers of each hotel could look into the topics specifically related to their hotels.
